Usage: bug_hunt.sh --agent {pi|claude} --model MODEL --effort LEVEL --publish {tracker|docs} [options]

Hunts for bugs without implementing fixes. Each credible bug is published as a
separate ticket with bug, difficulty, priority, and ready-for-agent labels.

Required:
  --agent NAME       pi or claude
  --model MODEL      Agent model
  --effort LEVEL     off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max
  --publish TARGET   tracker to create GitHub issues, or docs to write Markdown
                     tickets under docs/tickets/bug-hunt/

Options:
  --branch-only      Inspect only commits unique to the current branch and the
                     changes introduced by those commits
  --help

Environment:
  BUG_HUNT_MEMORY_MAX
                     Memory limit for the agent and all commands it starts when
                     a user systemd instance is available (default: 16G). Set
                     to an empty value to disable the limit.

Examples:
  tools/bug_hunt.sh --agent pi --model openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol \
    --effort high --publish tracker
  tools/bug_hunt.sh --agent claude --model opus --effort high \
    --publish docs --branch-only

Start with \`git log $commit_range\` and \`git diff $merge_base..HEAD\`.

Publish every ticket to this repository's GitHub issue tracker with `gh`; do not merely propose issue text in your response. Before publishing, inspect open and closed issues to avoid duplicates and inspect the repository's available labels. Apply exactly one existing `difficulty:*` label and exactly one existing `priority:*` label, plus `bug` and `ready-for-agent`, to every issue. If one new issue depends on another, create them in dependency order and set GitHub's native blocked-by relationship (`blockedBy`) on the dependent issue. A body link or textual "blocked by" note alone is not sufficient. Verify the final labels and native dependency metadata after creation.
EOF

    publish_prompt=$(cat <<'EOF'
Publish every ticket as a separate Markdown file under `docs/tickets/bug-hunt/`; do not create GitHub issues. Create the directory if needed, inspect existing tickets to avoid duplicates, and use stable, descriptive kebab-case filenames. Begin each file with YAML front matter containing `labels` with `bug`, exactly one `difficulty:*`, exactly one `priority:*`, and `ready-for-agent`. Include a `blockedBy` list containing the relative filenames of prerequisite tickets (or an empty list) so all dependencies are explicit and machine-readable. Do not modify files outside `docs/tickets/bug-hunt/`.

prompt=$(cat <<EOF
Perform a thorough bug hunt of this repository. You are running non-interactively: work autonomously, carry the investigation through publication, and do not stop at a plan or ask the user questions. Read and follow all repository instructions, domain documentation, and relevant ADRs before investigating.

$scope_prompt

Use code inspection, history, lightweight static analysis, and focused tests or builds where useful. Look for concrete correctness, safety, state-management, concurrency, persistence, error-handling, boundary-condition, and regression bugs. Trace behavior across call sites and test assumptions rather than relying on superficial pattern matching. Do not implement fixes and do not modify source code. Do not publish speculative concerns, style suggestions, refactors, feature requests, or test-only gaps unless they demonstrate a real product bug.

Keep every individual build, test, or analysis tool call bounded to at most 300 seconds and stream periodic progress to the tool output; do not hide all output in a file. Do not run GCC's \`-fanalyzer\`, Clang Static Analyzer, or another whole-project path-sensitive compiler analysis: these can consume unbounded time and memory on this codebase. Prefer the repository's normal build and focused test targets. If a command approaches its bound or shows pathological resource use, stop it and continue with other evidence.

For each distinct, credible bug, write a self-contained implementation-ready ticket containing:
- a precise title and concise impact summary;
- the affected files/symbols and evidence or reproduction steps;
- expected versus actual behavior and the likely root cause;
- focused acceptance criteria, including regression-test expectations;
- one estimated difficulty label from difficulty:trivial, difficulty:easy, difficulty:medium, or difficulty:hard;
- one priority label from priority:low, priority:medium, or priority:high.

Split independently fixable bugs into separate tickets. Combine only when one fix necessarily resolves the same root cause. Model dependencies only where work genuinely must be completed in order, and ensure every dependent ticket's blockedBy metadata is set correctly. If no credible bugs are found, publish nothing and report that result clearly.

$publish_prompt

At the end, summarize the investigation performed and list the tickets actually published, including their URLs or file paths and dependency relationships.
